									Himiko's ancestry consists of demon slayers and mage hackers.

									honing on her faculties. One of her great ancestors is Tenma Yatou so naturally she
									is a Chronos Lord from birthright.

											Being an all range tank allows Himiko to handle a variety of attacks. 
											Further, Himiko usually brings in all of her weapon arsenal consisting 
											of her poleaxe Hades, revolving shields and claymore lance Abetorre, twin
											katanas given to her by her father Akatsuki, monochromatic legguards Arondonight
											and Brynhilder, broadswords: Durandal, Diache, Ysatoth, and lotus sattelite cannon Avaldalis.
											In the battlefiled, Himiko prefers applying her keen intellect wishing to avoid
											using her ace cards until she is thrust into a very bad situation.<br>
											<br>
											As for her "armor" she is always wearing attires that are mandarin, crimson, and jet.
											She is often seen wearing a black tanktop, black shorts, and a black trenchcoat with a 												gradient mandarin to red trim around the collar. Her choice of footwear is knee high combat
											boots or her legguards in which the former sports of black boots and vermillion laces and the
											latter is monochoromatic black and white. Moreover, she has "Inverse" forms which boost her 											stats or grant her passives and what distinguishes those forms is the colour of the armor 												plates stacked around her chest and abdomen. Her inverse form Destructor always enables Himiko 												to be Omniscent under darkness, Apolyptica to regenerate out of void energy, Avenger to 											ensure that her Law of Vengeance is absolute, and Hilbelplace to bypass all immunities possible 											in both active mode and implicit mode.

											IOBS:<br>
											IOBS is the abbreviation for Ion Osscilation Blaster System it is a bombardement that destroys 												entire dimensions, combined with her gear eye it lays entire timelines to waste. Up to Himiko's 											successful implementation of the Impossible Karp Theoretics, anyone who attempted to implement 												IOBS either had their bodies handicapped or lost their capability to fight.
											<br><br>
											Siebens/Siebens Gladsheimr Judgement/Siebens Glepnir:<br>
											Emitting from seven of her shields Abetorre, the shields first mutate from their jet hue to 											that of a rainbow then with each of the shields she shoots laser beams of the appropiate colour.
											Each of the lasers are capable of taking away all of her opponents senses. Further, she can 											assemble the shields like a star to fire forth a light of seven colours and if she lands all of 											the laser beams, then her unbreakable chains Glepnir is guranteed to bind the opponent allowing 											her to finish her opponent off.

											Himiko is generally a compassionate and laid-back person. However when she is serious in 		situations such as a loved one on the verge of dying or the situation asking her to defend her convictions she is not afraid to take destructive and reckless measures even implicating herself to achieve her ends. In situations like those she can be somewhat brash and arrogant but at heart she wants to protect the ones that she loves the most and also takes every effort to ensure the intellect of those and her own intellect do not erode.  As such she is willing to take noble actions such as deflecting an incoming hit to prevent a city from being destroyed even though that means taking the recoil on herself.  Due to her Fire and Electric affinities she can act spunky and ballsy in some scenarios or accumulate feelings of lust and sadism. That said however, she can hold a grudge for a long time which in turn those grudges develop into feelings of vengeance.
